# Farah's Challenge â€“ Old Phone Keypad Decoder

This is my refined solution to Iron Software's C# coding challenge. The goal was to simulate how an old phone keypad works and translate button sequences into readable text.

## ðŸ“‹ Challenge Summary
The input is a string that simulates key presses on a classic mobile phone keypad. Each number corresponds to a group of letters (e.g., 2 = ABC, 3 = DEF).

- Repeating the same number selects the next letter in the group.
- A space `" "` represents a pause between letters.
- Asterisk `"*"` acts as backspace.
- Hash `"#"` marks the end of the input.

## ðŸ’¡ My Approach
I wrote the code step by step, thinking about how I would decode the message if I had to do it manually.  
The main method `OldPhonePad(string input)` processes the full input string. It builds each letter from repeated digits, handles backspaces, and recognizes pauses between letters.  
I split some logic into helper methods to keep the main method cleaner:
- One method converts a group of digits into a letter.
- Another maps digits to letters like on a phone keypad.

## ðŸ”„ Improvements Made
After your initial feedback, I made several enhancements to improve the code quality:

- **Better Documentation**: Added XML comments to all methods to make the code more maintainable.
- **Input Validation**: Added proper validation to handle edge cases like null inputs or missing end markers.
- **Performance Optimization**: Replaced string concatenation with `StringBuilder` for more efficient string manipulation.
- **Error Handling**: Implemented appropriate exception handling for better reliability.
- **Code Organization**: Structured the test cases more clearly with descriptive output.

## ðŸ™Œ Final Thoughts
This project was a fun way to put my logic and C# fundamentals into practice. I made sure to keep the code clear and easy to follow, while also incorporating best practices.  
Thanks for the opportunity to show how I approach and solve problems!

P.S. I really enjoyed working on this challenge â€” it made me think in a very visual and logical way.  
As a small twist (if you're up for it, Farah!), try typing your own name using the old phone keypad style.  
I'd love to know what key combination you would use â€” or even how you might approach the logic differently if you had another idea ðŸ˜Š

Thanks again for the opportunity!
